      question: "Who can join us ?",
      answer:
        "Anyone can join us, starting from the age of 4. If you have a health issue, we’ll design a plan tailored to your needs and help you achieve your ideal weight and shape.",
    },
    2: {
      question:
        "Are there any medications or formulas for weight gain or loss ?",
      answer:
        "Dr. Shrouk does not rely on appetite stimulants, formulas, herbs, cortisone, or medications, as these interfere with your hormones. Once you stop using them, you'll regain the weight.",
    },
    3: {
      question: "Are there any required tests ?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely, tests are very important to understand your current health status and help us design the right plan for you.",
    },
    4: {
      question: "How much weight change happens in a month ?",
      answer:
        "Weight change, whether gain or loss, varies from person to person because each body responds differently based on factors like genetics, family history, medical history, health condition, test results, and commitment to the plan and instructions.",
    },
    5: {
      question:
        "What’s special about online follow-ups with us, and why do we prefer them over offline ones?",
      answer:
        "The advantage is that you’ll have a dedicated team of nutritionists and trainers following up with you daily, monitoring your commitment to the plan, and answering all your questions and inquiries. This ensures we’re always keeping track of your progress and helping you achieve the best results.",
