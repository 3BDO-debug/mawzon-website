          "My follow-up with Dr. Shorouk was excellent. She helped me adjust my eating habits and provided many alternatives for certain things. The follow-up was daily on the plan I was following. I love sweets a bit, but she included recipes that made me not feel the need to resort to sugary treats. I lost about 10 kilograms in four months, even though I wasn't focused on exercise at first because of work. If I had paid more attention to it, the progress would have been even better. I didn’t feel deprived at all; even during the Eid holidays, I didn’t feel like ruining the diet. If I ever slipped, she encouraged me to get back on track as if nothing happened. The difference in measurements is very noticeable, both in my home clothes and the outfits I didn’t like how I looked in before. Thank God, things have improved a lot.",

With your help, I was even able to maintain natural breastfeeding despite my daughter’s dairy allergy, which forced me to cut out those products. I used to always feel weak and dizzy, but with your guidance, I improved significantly, and breastfeeding and milk production became much better. Plus, I got my body back.",

Secondly, my acid reflux almost completely disappeared when I followed the plan and Dr. Shorouk’s instructions. It’s truly gone, and now I can sleep without any issues with acidity. Thirdly, there’s a significant change in my appearance, which has improved my mood, boosted my confidence, and made me happy with how my body looks. Lastly, the daily follow-ups with you made it so easy for me to stick to the plan. So, truly, thank you.",

The plan was extremely flexible, and I learned how to eat well without ever feeling forced. I gained 10 kilograms and benefited from the doctor’s advice regarding food. She helped me understand what works for me and what doesn’t, which made me much healthier overall.",

I used to wake up with stomach pain, but now about 80% of that morning and daily discomfort has gone away, thank God . The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, like bloating and other issues, have also disappeared. This was actually the reason I couldn’t eat much before.",

          "I had issues with my digestive system, colitis, H. pylori infection, and a thyroid problem. I had been struggling with thinness for four years, eating only two meals a day, until I came across Dr. Shorouk on Instagram and signed up with her. She created a plan tailored to my condition, and within the first two weeks, I noticed a difference and improvement in my body. I started eating more than three main meals and two snacks, and the plan eliminated my need for sugary foods. I learned what foods suit my stomach and colon. I signed up with her for three months—my weight was 45 kg and became 53 kg, so I gained 8 kg, even though I wasn’t 100% committed to the plan. Thank God, my appetite improved, and I started eating more. I want to thank Dr. Shorouk for her efforts with me; she is very kind, sweet, and cooperative. What I achieved with her is truly a great accomplishment.",

In the beginning, my stomach couldn’t even handle water, and I didn’t enjoy food. Now, my body has improved significantly, and everyone who sees me notices it and tells me that even my face looks good and not skinny anymore.",

There was also no pressure to eat specific foods. I gained 6 kilograms in two months, even while breastfeeding.

Dr. Shorouq is truly excellent, and the credit goes to her after God for her effort and dedication with me. Honestly, I've never gained this amount of weight in such a short time before. The program was very healthy, and if there was something I didn’t like, I would let her know, and there was no pressure to eat anything. Now, I eat a lot; before, I could go more than 6 hours without eating, but now if 3 hours pass, I feel very hungry. There’s been no negative effect on my health; on the contrary, my life has improved, and I always feel energized. The seven kilograms I gained are a big deal for me because they made a huge difference. I never expected to reach this point, but thank God, and I thank her a thousand times .",

The meal plans were flexible, convenient, and included all the foods I love. Before starting, I used to feel very lethargic, but now my energy has increased, I move easily, and I’ve recovered from fatty liver. My insulin resistance has also disappeared, as confirmed by my internal medicine doctor.",

          "Dr. Shorouq is truly amazing; she is dedicated to her work and very meticulous with follow-ups and appointments. It’s clear that her priority is to help her clients, and she puts in a noticeable effort. The eating plan is fantastic. I gained 6.5 kilograms with her, something I never dreamed of. I learned what to eat, how to eat, and when to eat. I used to be someone who didn’t understand my body at all, and I even learned how to prepare complete meals for my children. The program was very flexible, and there was never anything without an alternative. My health has improved significantly; my hair has become stronger, my body feels better, my skin has brightened, and my face looks better. I feel hungry now. I stopped following up with her, but my appetite hasn’t decreased, nor have I lost any weight, and I’m still following her advice. May God reward her and her entire team with goodness.",

          "I have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and my problem was that I couldn’t eat properly and always had to take medication to regulate my period. Dr. Shorouk’s plan opened up my appetite for food and even helped me organize my daily routine. I gained about 7 kilograms with her, which is a number I had never reached before. I had tried many diets, but no one managed to help me achieve this except Dr. Shorouk. Everyone around me noticed the change in my body shape, and the weight gain was very balanced. The plan didn’t involve any pressure to eat specific foods, and my appetite improved significantly. Even when I stopped following the plan for three months, I didn’t lose any weight and remained stable, which is honestly an achievement ♥️. Thank God, my period is now regular without the medication I used to take. The follow-up with her was truly wonderful and comfortable. She addressed all my issues, not just the diet, and she pays attention to everything I tell her ♥️.",
