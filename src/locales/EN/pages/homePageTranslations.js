          "My experience with Dr. Shorouq has been excellent. She helped me adjust my diet and provided several alternatives for different things. She also followed up with me daily on the plan I was following. I tend to like sweets, but she included recipes that made me not feel the need to turn to sugary foods. I lost around 10 kilograms in 4 months, even though I wasn’t very focused on exercising at first because of work. If I had, the results would have been even better. I never felt deprived, especially during Eid when I didn’t feel the urge to go off the diet. If I ever slipped, she encouraged me to get back on track as if nothing had happened. The difference in measurements is very noticeable, especially in my home and outdoor clothes, where I used to dislike how I looked. Thankfully, things have improved a lot.",

          "Thank you so much, doctor. Honestly, without your help, I wouldn't have been able to reach this weight during breastfeeding. With your guidance, I also managed to maintain breastfeeding, even though I was struggling due to my daughter's dairy allergy and had to cut out dairy products. I used to feel dizzy and weak all the time, but with your support, I improved, and my milk supply got much better. Plus, I got my body back",

Secondly, my acid reflux almost disappeared when I started sticking to regular meal times and supplements. It’s gone, and now I can sleep without needing anything for heartburn. Thirdly, my appearance has changed a lot, and that boosted my confidence. I feel much better about how I look, and I’m really happy with my body now. Lastly, the daily follow-up with you made it easy for me to stay consistent with the plan. So, thank you so much .",

The plan was extremely flexible, and I learned how to eat well without ever feeling forced. I gained 10 kilograms and benefited from the doctor’s advice regarding food. She helped me understand what works for me and what doesn’t, which made me much healthier overall.",

I used to wake up with stomach pain, but now about 80% of that morning and daily discomfort has gone away, thank God . The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, like bloating and other issues, have also disappeared. This was actually the reason I couldn’t eat much before.",

In the beginning, my stomach couldn’t even handle water, and I didn’t enjoy food. Now, my body has improved significantly, and everyone who sees me notices it and tells me that even my face looks good and not skinny anymore.",

          "Dr. Shorouq, I honestly can’t find the words to describe the follow-up with her . I lost about 4 kilograms in a month, but those 4 kilograms feel like 8 because the difference in body measurements is significant. I’ve almost returned to my usual weight, and all my clothes fit better than before . Moreover, my health has improved a lot, as confirmed by my endocrinologist. I haven’t felt dizzy, weak, or had cravings for food. I’ve been following her plan without feeling deprived, as it’s well-balanced, even allowing for chocolate and coffee, which I can’t live without . I also appreciate that she focuses on addressing the health issues of her clients, which was the reason I chose her in the first place.",

          "I was 48 kilograms and reached 55, thank God, in just a month. I was about 80% committed. Dr. Shorouq is truly excellent, and the credit goes to her after God for her effort and dedication with me. Honestly, I've never gained this amount of weight in such a short time before. The program was very healthy, and if there was something I didn’t like, I would let her know, and there was no pressure to eat anything. Now, I eat a lot; before, I could go more than 6 hours without eating, but now if 3 hours pass, I feel very hungry. There’s been no negative effect on my health; on the contrary, my life has improved, and I always feel energized. The seven kilograms I gained are a big deal for me because they made a huge difference. I never expected to reach this point, but thank God, and I thank her a thousand times .",

          "Dr. Shorouq is truly amazing; she is dedicated to her work and very meticulous with follow-ups and appointments. It’s clear that her priority is to help her clients, and she puts in a noticeable effort. The eating plan is fantastic. I gained 6.5 kilograms with her, something I never dreamed of. I learned what to eat, how to eat, and when to eat. I used to be someone who didn’t understand my body at all, and I even learned how to prepare complete meals for my children. The program was very flexible, and there was never anything without an alternative. My health has improved significantly; my hair has become stronger, my body feels better, my skin has brightened, and my face looks better. I feel hungry now. I stopped following up with her, but my appetite hasn’t decreased, nor have I lost any weight, and I’m still following her advice. May God reward her and her entire team with goodness.",

          "Dr. Shorouq is one of the sweetest doctors I’ve worked with. She understands her work very well and knows exactly what she’s doing. The daily follow-ups, care, and prompt responses to questions are invaluable. I’ll never forget a day when I was feeling down; she stayed with me and didn’t leave until I felt better. May God reward her with all the good . I gained about 6 kilograms in two months, and this is also because I’m breastfeeding, which I never expected would lead to weight gain. I had lost hope of ever gaining weight while breastfeeding, but thank God .",

I reached my goal that I have been trying to achieve for years, and I have set a new goal that we will reach together, God willing. The doctor was very comforting, and this period has been pleasant; this is the most important achievement I’ve made in 2024 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹.",
